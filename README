Disk stores blocks of BLOCKSIZE*2 characters, each character representing 4 bits in hex

Superblock:
0: 0x5A (magic number)
1-2: 0x0001 (block of root inode)
3-4: block address of inode of currently open file (0x0001 if "nothing" currently open)
5-255: bitmap of free blocks - limits max # of blocks to 8*251 = 2014 blocks

Addressing:
max of 2014 (2^11) blocks requires 11 bits to index so addresses are all 2 bytes
stores first block address of file, each data block's last 2 bytes are dedicated to the address of the next block in the file.
EOF represented by address 0xFFFF, which is always out of range. (0x07ED is the maximum address of our FS)

Inodes:
0: inode type (0x00 for file, 0x01 for directory)
file:
    1-2: address of first data block
    3-5: total number of bytes in file
    (MAXBLOCKS(2014) - 3 (superblock, root inode, this inode)) * (256 (blocksize) - 2 (addr of next)) - 8(filename) = ~2^19
directory:
    1-8: filename of first entry
    9-10: address of inode of first entry
    repeat those 10 bytes for each entry

Data blocks:
    block 0:
    0-7: filename
    ~~any additional metadata here~~
    8-253: data
    254-255: address of next data block

    blocks 1+:
    0-253: data
    254-255: address of next data block
